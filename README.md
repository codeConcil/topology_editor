# This repo is an implementation of the paper "Method of 3D enterprise topology reconstruction with object contours detection for digital twin creation"

# Quick Start
You can use the demo version of this editor to check our research results.


In this repository, we uploaded a prepared build with the ability to view the results of topology reconstruction. 

For testing you need a personal computer with Windows 7 or newer.

Just download all materials using - ${\color{red}git clone}$ command or directly:  ${\color{red}button Code -> Download ZIP}$

Then extract the archive (if you downloaded ZIP) and follow the path ${\color{red}Build -> ‘DubaiPort-Demo.exe’.}$ 
After launching you will be able to move the camera in the editor:
1. Right mouse button - camera angle
2. Mouse wheel - zoom
3. left mouse button - move the camera
 
In case of any problems, please let us know using Issues on github
